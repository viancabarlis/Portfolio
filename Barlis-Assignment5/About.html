            <p>Monast was started by Benjamin Hernandez.  I am a desk and computer setup enthusiast who is currently residing in the Charlotte, NC area.
            I have spent most of my life behind a computer working and finding ways to improve my setup while learning everything in front of a desk.
            After being satisfied with everything I have learned over the years, I created Monast to help others achieve their dream setup.
            Delivering the best PC, keyboard, and desk building services coverage of the setup scene, Monast provides the best consultation for your needs.</p>

        <h2 class="goals">GOALS</h2>
            <p>Monast's goal is to provide the best consultation and services for your needs.  I build computers tailored to the needs of the client.
                Whether it be for gaming, office work, streaming, etc.  I will work to ensure that the build is <strong>affordable</strong>.</p>
            <p>I make bespoke luxury mechanical keyboards.  In today's technology use, people spend about as much time typing away on keyboards as we
                do staring at our phones and always looking to own the next flagship device.  Only a few think about improving their typing experience,
                let alone thinking it is something worth investing in.  Monast looks to change that.</p>
            <p>I specialize in having an ergonomics setup to <strong>prevent</strong> long-term injury associated with sitting at a desk for long periods of time.
                There is plenty of tweaks and ways to have your desk setup to give you the best ergonomic experience.</p>
